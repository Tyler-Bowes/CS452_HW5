# Overview

This program is a developed Linux module that implements a device drive. It
is performed on a virtual machine.  The program writes a kernel module. A 
Scanner is used to help split a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens 
based on the position of separators.  As of right now the scanner in the driver
does not function correctly but the the driver is being created and run.  I have 
create a user space implementation of the Scanner.c file that works but was unable
to get it functioning inside the kernel space.  Other than that the driver is 
working in full function.

# Testing/Test Suit

To test the scanner I used different sequences of tokens which are all different lengths.
First I made sure it works as normal with a "simple" sequence like "cat:dog:bug".  Then
I would test a 0 token length, like "cat::dog".  After making sure that works I used 
tokens that exeeded the buffer length.  After going through a few more edge case checks
of making sure the scanner would read and write the sequences I was confident that it would
work with all sequences.

Sequences inside testing_seq were used to test the scanner.  each line is a sequence used.

# Compiling

To compile and run this program you must have the fedora.img in your folder and run
" $  ~jbuffenb/classes/452/pub/bin/hw5boot"
to create your virtual machine.  Once you do that you will have to copy your files
into the vm.  To do that you run the command:
" $ scp -P 2222 -r {your directory path of Scanner folder} cs452@localhost:"

After coping the files into your VM you go into the VM by running " $ ssh -p 2222 cs452@localhost"

Now that you are inside your VM go into that directory and run 
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ make try
    
    Then you can exit the vm by running $ exit

After you exit, you will want to close the VM by running " ssh -p 2222 cs452@localhost
    sudo -S shutdown -h 0"


# Demo

This is what happens when I run the program inside the VM after going inside the Scanner file.
This demo includes the making of the program to executing program.
